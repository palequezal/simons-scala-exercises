<h2>Task 1: Embrace the Future, without exception</h2>

<p>Oh, oh my, the puns. By the end of this chapter you'll be <em>rolling around the floor</em> about that one.</p>

<p>Ehem...</p>

<p>So we're now somewhat familiar with Monad theory and how Options work. You should be able to deduce that</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        a monad is essentially a wrapper type that contains some data (it's really a Typeclass, but we'll get into
        those another time)
    </li>
    <li>
        they are usually used in code to abstract away common, "boilerplate" problems and give context about how we
        expect to have to handle the data
    </li>
    <li>they commonly have subtypes that express the state the data is in</li>
    <li>mapping on the contents of a monad will perform the necessary </li>
</ul>

<h2>The problem Futures solve</h2>

<p>
    In the case of <code>Option</code>, the boilerplate problem they solve is performing <code>null</code> checks and
    the context they give us is that a value may or may not exist. They then have two types, <code>Some()</code> and
    <code>None</code> which tell us about the end state of the data.
</p>

<p>
    A <code>Future</code> deals with the problem of waiting for asynchronous data and the fact that the asynchronous call
    could fail and never return a value.

<p>
    If you've not heard the term "asynchronous" before, it essentially means that we
    won't wait for the code to finish executing, we'll instead stick it on something called the "stack" and let it complete
    in the background.
</p>

<p>
    When it's completed we'll then return the value or say that it failed. This avoids us locking up
    our system while long complex operations are taking place.
</p>

<h2>States of a Future</h2>

<p>
    Just like Option, a Future has a content type - in this case, it's the type of the value we're expecting as a result
    from the asynchronous operation.
</p>

<p>
    The semantics we use with <code>Future[T]</code> are that it can either <em>succeed</em> with the value of type
    <code>T</code>, or <em>fail</em> by returning an Exception that the system will <code>throw</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Two completed Futures that attempt to get a String value could look like this:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        // Under the hood this is translated to Future(Success("Hello"))
        Future.successful("Hello")

        // Under the hood this is translated to Future(Failure(new Exception("Couldn't get the string")))
        Future.failed(new Exception("Couldn't get the string"))

        // both Success and Failure are from the scala.util package
    </code>
</pre>

<h2>Mapping on Futures</h2>

<p>You can <code>map()</code> on Future in the same way that you can for all other Monadic/Functor types.</p>

<p>
    Just like how <code>map()</code> only runs on an Option if the result is <code>Some()</code>, it will only run on a
    Future if the Future succeeds.
</p>

<p>You can use <code>flatMap()</code> to chain futures together too.</p>

<h2>Execution Contexts</h2>

<p>
    When using Futures, an <code>implicit ExecutionContext</code> needs to be in scope. ExecutionContexts are what are used
    behind the scenes to execute your Futures, so without one your code won't even compile.
</p>

<p>
    For writing tests an ExecutionContext can be imported from <code>scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global</code>
    but in your actual production code you should inject an ExecutionContext instance using Dependency Injection at either class
    or method level.
</p>

<h2>Some important notes about using Futures</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Only use Future.successful or Future.failed when you're sure of the outcome (i.e. the code has finished running)</li>
    <li>for example, don't do this Future.successful(somethingThatWillTakeAges()) - you're saying it's suceeded when it's
        not finished and this can lock up your code and prevent it from ever finishing</li>
</ul>
