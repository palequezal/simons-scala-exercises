    <h1>Definition: What is a Monad?</h1>
    <p>
        The term "Monad" comes from Category Theory and is often confusing/opaque to new Scala developers as it's something you hear
        mentioned a lot but unless you come from a mathematical background are likely to not be familiar with.
    </p>

    <h2>The programmer's perspective</h2>
    <p>
        Simply speaking, in coding, a Monad is one of many possible design patterns that can be used to abstract away common functionality
        so that we can (amongst other things):
    </p>



    <ul>
        <li>make better reasoning about the code simply from reading it</li>
        <li>enforce at compile time certain rules that ensure our data is not handled in unexpected ways</li>
        <li>reduce silly bugs in our code (though of course not eliminating the chance of bugs entirely)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A great example of this is the Maybe monad, which in Scala is called <strong>Option</strong>.</p>

    <p>Imagine you're writing a method for a chip shop order app to create fish and chips. You need some sort of
        Fish and some Chips to make an order, so you need to check that both parameters have been provided.
        <a href="psi_element://Main#prepareOrder">Traditionally you might do something like this</a>:
    </p>
    <br>

    <pre>
        <code>
            def prepareOrder(fish: Fish, chips: Chips): FishAndChips = {
                if (fish == null) null
                else if (chips == null) null
                else FishAndChips(Fish, Chips)
            }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Crap, isn't it... Why? Well...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the method can return null as well as FishAndChips but we can't tell that from the method signature</li>
        <li>every parameter that can be null has to have a null check which clutters the code</li>
        <li>the sentence "I have null fish" makes no sense, so the data is nonsensical</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        So...
        <ul>
            <li>we have a piece of common functionality that we want to abstract away; a null check</li>
            <li>we want to reference and reinforce the optional nature of the data in our method signature</li>
        </ul>

        This is where our Option monad comes in to help.
    </p>

    <h2>Our method, refactored to use Options</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="psi_element://Main#prepareOrderImproved">Take a look at the updated method</a>, but don't worry too
        much about the implementation for now - this will be explained later in a section about some Scala magic called
        "For comprehensions".
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Observations</h3>

    <p>The functionality is essentially the same, but note how the null checks have gone.</p>
    <p>Note also that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the method parameters are now Option[Fish] and Option[Chips] and the method returns Option[FishAndChips]</li>
        <li>within the method body I never reference Options at all, but there are no compilation errors</li>
        <li>IntelliJ (and the Scala compiler) magically knows that the method will return an Option[FishAndChips] despite this</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This point references one part of the essential nature of a Monad - that when you perform an operation on the
        contents of a Monad, the result is also wrapped in a Monad of the <strong>same type</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        So therefore looking at the method signature alone, we can deduce that we don't have to provide fish or chips, but that depending on what we provide
        we may not get FishAndChips. Makes a lot of sense right?
    </p>
