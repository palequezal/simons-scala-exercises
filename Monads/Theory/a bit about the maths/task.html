<html><h1>A bit about the maths</h1>

<p>This term... Monad... where did it come from and what do we mean when we use it? We've learned a little bit about what you can <em>do</em> with them, but not <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>Monad is a term from Category theory, but to understand it, first let's learn a little about Functors.</p>

<h2>Functors</h2>

<p>You: Oh no, another opaque term! You explain an opaque term with <em>another</em> one?! Are you some sort of sadist or something?</p>

<p>Me: ...</p>

<p>Imagine you try and define a box in code. Let's look at some requirements for a box</p>

<ol>
    <li>A box can contain something</li>
    <li>it therefore needs some means to put something inside it</li>
    <li>unless we're just happy with things being in the box, we need some means of manipulating it's contents</li>
    <li>we should be able to take out the original contents of the box and replace them with something else</li>
    <li>the box can be in two basic states; empty or full</li>
</ol>

<p>So in some Scala code we define a class called <code>Box[A]</code>, where <code>A</code> denotes the type of the contents of our box, which can be anything - even another box - the possibilities are endless!!</p>

<p>Let's define it for real real...</p>

<h2>Box[A]</h2>

<pre>
    <code>
        class Box[+A](val contents: A) {
            def map[A, B](methodToActOnContents: A => B): Box[B] =
                new Box(methodToActOnContents(contents))
        }

        object Box {
            def apply[A](contents: A): Box[A] =
                new Box(contents)
        }
    </code>
</pre>

<p>To summarise:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>apply()</code> puts something in a box</li>
    <li><code>map()</code> allows us to alter the contents of the box (and returns the result in a new box</li>
    <li><code>apply()</code> is specified on a companion object so we don't need an instance of a box to use it</li>
</ul>

<p>What we have created here is a <code>Functor</code>. A functor is a wrapper type that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>has a means of wrapping a value in it (in our case <code>apply()</code>)</li>
    <li>a means of manipulating the contents, which returns a new wrapped value</li>
    <li>defines the context and method by which the contents can be operated on</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding context to <code>Box[A]</code></h2>

<p>As we mentioned earlier, a box can be empty or full, so let's create those as new types that extend Box.</p>

<p>We'll have to make some changes to Box to make this work, so let's re-do it as Box2</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Make Box2 an <code>abstract class</code> because the Empty and Full() types we're going to create will set the contents.
        <ul>
            <li>
                We need to be able to create different instances of it so it can't be a <code>trait</code> or an
                <code>object</code> (traits can't be instantiated and an object <em>is</em> an instance)
            </li>
            <li>We can't provide the contents yet because Full and Empty will have to set them</li>
            <li>We still need some reference to the contents method so we can pass it into <code>map()</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>add an isEmpty method to see if there is anything in the box</li>
    <li>
        Update the allowed types from <code>A</code> to <code>+A</code>, which means we'll allow anything that
        extends <code>Box2</code> to be equivalent to a <code>Box2</code>. By default Box2, Empty and Full will be considered
        different types by the compiler
    </li>
</ol>

<p>We can then create our Empty and full subtypes</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        case class Full[A](contents: A) {
            val isEmpty = false
        }

        class EmptyBoxException extends Exception("This box doesn't have any contents because it is empty")

        case object Empty extends Box2[Nothing] {
            val isEmpty = true
            def contents = throw new EmptyBoxException
        }
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    <em>Now</em>, when you try to <code>map()</code> on a <code>Full()</code>, it will do whatever it is you intend to the contents and
    return you a <code>Full()</code> back.
</p>

<p>If you try and <code>map()</code> on an Empty, you can't becaus there's no contents, so it simply returns <code>Empty</code>.</p>

<p>
    If you're in any way familiar with Scala, you may have noticed that what we've essentially created is a basic form of
    <code>Option</code>, just using different semantics. But we're not quite at Monads yet. There's just one final step...</p>

<h2>The final step to Monads</h2>

<p>We now have our Box2[A] Functor and we want to make it a monad. So what is a monad? <em>FINALLY?@</em></p>

<p>The answer is simple. A monad is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Everything a Functor is</li>
    <li>plus the ability to combine it with other Monads</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In Scala, this means we add one more method called <code>flatMap()</code> which is nearly identical to
    <code>map()</code>, but only returns B instead of a Box2[B]. This means our manipulation method has to return a Box2[B],
    which could be... ANOTHER BOX... so you see we can chain them together and do something with all of their combined data.
</p>

<p>
    I won't go into any more detail here about <code>flatMap()</code> because I explain it fully in the Options chapter,
    which I suggest you go check out now!
