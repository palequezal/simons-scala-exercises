<h1>Task 3: joining Options together</h1>

<p>
    We know that the <code>map()</code> method allows us to work with the contents of our Options, but
    what about when we have multiple options and we want to combine the contents of all of them and do something
    with all the data, returning the result in a single Option?
</p>

<p>
    This defines the critical component of a Monad; that it can be chained together
    with other monads of the same kind. The fancy term for this is "Monadic composition", if you're interested.
</p>

<p>
    In Haskell this method is referred to as <strong>bind</strong>, which makes a lot of sense. In Scala, they opted for
    the slightly more opaque <code>flatMap()</code>.
</p>

<p>
    As you'll see later on however, <code>flatMap()</code> is still a perfectly valid description for what it does, but
    I personally find bind to be a more useful descriptor.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Under the hood</h2>

<p>
    Let's take a look at Option's definition of <code>flatMap()</code>:
</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        def flatMap[B](f: A => Option[B]): Option[B]
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Compare this with the definition of <code>map()</code>:
</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        def map[B](f: A => B): Option[B]
    </code>
</pre>

<p>If you missed it, the essential differences are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>map()</code> takes a method that must return something of type <code>B</code>, then wraps the result in an <code>Option</code> for you</li>
    <li><code>flatMap()</code> takes a method that must return an <code>Option[B]</code>, but does <em>no such wrapping</em> for you</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Through clever whizzy magic, this allows us to nest together great chains of <code>Option</code> Monads as long as at
    some point an Option is returned.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at an example where we join together 3 options using <code>flatMap()</code> and <code>map()</code>
</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        val optInt1 = Some(1)
        val optInt2 = Some(2)
        val optInt3 = Some(3)

        val result = optInt1.flatMap { int1 =>
            optInt2.flatMap { int2 =>
                optInt3.map { int3 =>
                    int1 + int2 + int3
                }
            }
        }
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Note how the innermost option has used <code>map()</code> instead of <code>flatMap()</code>. Why do you think that is?
</p>

<p>
    Got you! I'm sure you didn't start this course to guess, so I'll tell you. Still, it's good to exercise the old
    grey matter from time to time! If you remember, <code>flatMap()</code> must return an Option[B], but optInt2 is also flat mapped,
    so that must also return an option. <code>map()</code> wraps the result in an Option for us, so when all methods have ran
    we're left with an Option[Int] containing the number 6.
</p>

<p>
    I like to think of it that when we're flat mapping, we're plucking the contents out of the Option and throwing it away,
    sort of like a greedy goblin that's stealing the pigeon eggs from a sequence of nests... Or something...
