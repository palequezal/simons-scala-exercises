<h1>Task 1: the "map()" method</h1>

<p>So we have our Option monad that does <code>null</code> checks, but how do we do stuff with our Fish and Chips
    when they exist?</p>

<p>Enter the <code>map()</code> method. Easy to understand nam, right? Don't worry you'll get it in time.</p>
<br>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>Say you're in your car and you need to get from place A to place B. What would help you get there? A <strong>map</strong>, of course!</p>

<p>So in Monad terms - and it works with any Monad - the <code>map()</code> method allows you to describe <em>how</em>
    to get from the current contents of the Monad to what you want.</p>

<p>This means you can do lots of magical things to the current contents, you can manipulate it, swap it out for something else
    or even throw the contents away entirely and replace it with something else.</p>

<p>e.g., say I have an order and I want to swap the type of chips in it, I can do this:</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        val codAndRegularOrder = Some(FishAndChips(Cod, Regular))

        val result = codAndRegularOrder.map(order => order.copy(chips = Battered))
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Ooh, nice! Can you guess what the value of <code>result</code> might be?</p>
<p>That's right, it's <code>Some(FishAndChips(Cod, Battered))</code>. Don't worry if you didn't get it, I'll explain why...</p>

<p>Let's have a closer look at the above. Between the brackets we have this construction, using a "fat arrow":</p>
<br>

<code>something => somethingElse</code>

<p>What this defines is a <strong>morphism</strong>, another fancy word for a transition from one category to another.
    Any <strong>type</strong> in scala is considered a category and we can define methods that describe how to alter one thing into another,
    though don't forget, the result can be the same type as the original data
    In fact, if we look at the definition of map for the Option Monad, it's:</p>
<br>

<code>def map[B](f: A => B): Option[B]</code>

<p>Ooooh it's almost as if I was dropping you hints earlier or something! map accepts a method which takes a value of type A
    (which here is understood to be the existing contents of the Option) to type B, which it infers from the return type of
    said method.</p>

<p>For example if I want to throw away the FishAndChips and replace it with a String value that say's "Hello" (for whatever reason)
    I could provide a method like the below as the parameter for <code>map()</code>:</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        fishAndChips => "Hello!"
    </code>
</pre>

<p>the bit on the left-hand side of the arrow (<code>=></code>) is a reference that refers to the existing contents of the monad. You can call it
    whatever you want, but make sure it's meaningful (naming things well is half the battle when it comes to code)</p>

<p>On the right-hand side is the method body where we decide what we want to do. Here we throw away the current contents of the
    monad and replace it with something else, but we could have also used that "<code>fishAndChips</code>" reference
    to do something with the existing data.</p>

<p>In the above example, because we're not actually using the contents of the monad for anything,
    by convention we would usually use the <strong>wildcard operator</strong> ( <code>_</code> ) instead of assigning
    a reference to the existing data to imply that we don't care about it. Awww... e.g.</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        codAndRegularOrder.map(_ => "Hello!")
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Take aways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>map()</code> takes a <strong>method</strong> as a parameter that goes from "A to B" (type A to type B)</li>
    <li>B need not be different to A</li>
    <li>type B is inferred from the <strong>return type</strong> of the method</li>
    <li>the result is ALWAYS wrapped back in a Monad of the same type, which in this case is an Option</li>

</ul>
