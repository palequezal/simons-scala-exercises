<h2>Task 2: Creating Option values</h2>

<p>
    We now have the ability to work with an existing <code>Option</code>, but how would we go about making our own?
</p>

<p>
   The <code>Option[T]</code> monad has two sub types in Scala, <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code>
</p>

<h2>Some</h2>
<p>
    <code>Some</code> has the semantic meaning that the value is present. You create a <code>Some</code> value using it's <code>apply()</code> method,
    which can be done like either example below, both are equivalent
</p>
<ol>
    <li><code>Some(???)</code></li>
    <li><code>Some.apply(???)</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
    ... Where "???" is whatever you want to put inside the option. The type of the contents will be inferred from whatever you
    put inside, so <code>Some(1)</code> has the type Option[Int] and <code>Some("Hello")</code> has the type Option[String]
</p>

<p>
    By convention we tend to use <code>Some()</code>, rather than <code>Some.apply()</code> because it's more readable, but
    it's useful to know what's happening under the hood, should you need it at some point. Some point, get it?
</p>
<br>

<h2>None</h2>
<p>
    <code>None</code> represents the absence of a value. It doesn't take a type, but None works with any Option as under the
    hood it's technically <code>Option[Nothing]</code> and <code>Nothing</code> is a subtype of every type.
</p>

<h2>Question 5</h2>
<div class="hint">
    The only difference here is the use of braces (curly brackets) <code>{ }</code> instead of round brackets <code>( )</code>.
    Braces define a multi-line block of code, whereas everything must be on one line between round brackets.
</div>

<h2>Question 9</h2>
<div class="hint">
    When you write Option(1), you're actually using syntactic sugar for Option.apply(1)
</div>
