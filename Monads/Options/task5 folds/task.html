<h1>Task 5: Folds</h1>
<p>Ah... <code>fold()</code>... One of those lovely methods that confuse the hell out of new Scala developers - and with good reason - it&#39;s often used in places where something more intuitive could (and should) be used. Let&#39;s have a look at what it does and see why.</p>

<h2>fold()</h2>

<p>If we take a look at the signature for the <code>fold()</code> method, we see that it has two parameter lists; the first is a method called &quot;ifEmpty&quot; and the second is also a method that takes A and returns B:</p>
<p><code>def fold[B](ifEmpty: =&gt; B)(f: A =&gt; B): B</code></p>
<p>So essentially what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<ul>
    <li>providing a method to act on the contents of the Option if it exists</li>
    <li>providing a default for when the Option is empty</li>
</ul>

<p>If you remember from the previous tasks (which you should because of how fantastic they were), this could also be written as <code>map()</code> with a <code>getOrElse()</code>. For example:</p>

<h3>map() and getOrElse() version</h3>
<pre><code>
    optFishAndChips
        .map(_ =&gt; "Thanks for my fish and chips!")
        .getOrElse("Meany, I'm telling DAD!")
</code></pre>

<h3 id="fold-version">fold() version</h3>
<pre><code>
    optFishAndChips.fold("Meany, I'm telling DAD!")(_ =&gt; "Thanks for my fish and chips!")
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I prefer the readability of the former because getOrElse() makes it more explicit that the value provided is a fallback.</p>

<h2>Folds with sequential data</h2>

<p>Folds make more sense in the context of Sequences, Lists, Sets etc, because they contain multiple values which you can then &quot;fold&quot; into a single value via a method that you define. </p>
<p>In that sense the idiom makes much more sense, but with Options, just use getOrElse - nobody thinks you&#39;re clever by using fold just because it&#39;s possible!</p>
<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>
    val prices = Seq(1.5, 2.99, 10.00)

    val total = prices.fold(0){ (price1, price2) =&gt;
      price1 + price2
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Even in this case though, it&#39;s ridiculous to use fold because in Scala you can just use the <code>sum()</code>, which is both idiomatic and far more readable:</p>

<pre><code>
    val prices = Seq(1.5, 2.99, 10.00)

    val total = prices.sum
</code></pre>

<h2>Folding strings</h2>

<p>OK, Ok, I can see you're hungry for one more example as to why you won't need to use folds. How about making strings?</p>

<p>
    You could do something like the below... (note: <code>foldLeft()</code> and <code>foldRight()</code> are just
    convenience methods that fold the data from the left to right, or right to left, respectively)
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        val optSomething = Some("Hello")

        optSomething.foldRight("Simon")( (left, right) => s"$left right")
        // would return "Hello Simon"

        optSomething.foldLeft("Simon")( (left, right) => s"left right")
        /* would return "Simon Hello" because it goes
        the other way and the 1st parameter list
        becomes the first value */
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Or perhaps, with a Sequence of strings we want to join?</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        val seqSomething = Seq("Hello", "Simon")
        seqSomething.foldRight("")( (left, right) => left + " " + right)
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Starts to fall apart here, doesn't it? We have to set the first parameter list value to "" to avoid it messing up
    our result.
</p>

<p>
    You could simplify it a little using <code>reduce()</code> instead...
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        seqSomething.reduce( (a, b) => s"$a $b" )
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    ... But again, a more readable example in scala, which I would recomend using is <code>mkString()</code>, which is
    available on all 'traversable' types (e.g. Seq, List etc).
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        seqSomething.mkString(" ")

        // or, using infix notation

        seqSomething mkString " "
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Much better, no? Same result, much more readable, no <code>fold()</code> nonsense!</p>

<p>
    Ultimately, I can't stop you using <code>fold()</code>, this is just to give you an overview of how it works and what
    your alternatives are if you don't want the developers who work on your coode after you've gone to hate you.
