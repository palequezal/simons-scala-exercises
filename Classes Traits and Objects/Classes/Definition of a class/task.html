<h1>Definition of a "class"</h1>

<p>It's almost tradition at this point to use Animals to illustrate this concept, so let's go with that...</p>

<p>Imagine an animal - any animal - how would you define it?</p>

<p>Well, to begin with, in code we can create a new type that represents an Animal called a <code>class</code>.</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        class Animal
    </code>
</pre>

<p>We can now create what are called <code>instances</code> of the class using the <code>new</code> keyword.</p>

<p>
    When we say we're creating an "instance" we mean that we're creating something that essentially follows the same
    "blueprint", but is a separate entity that can have different data. Let's create some instances that represent my cats,
    as an example.
</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        val eric = new Animal
        val spooky = new Animal
    </code>
</pre>

<p>We now have two different instances of Animal, representing my cats, but it's a bit... Vague, isn't it?</p>

<h2>Adding some functionality to Animal</h2>

<p>
    We can add data and methods to Animal that better describes them and what they can do.
    You could end up going to incredible depth here, so let's say for our (highly inaccurate) purposes,
    we're going to say an Animal is something that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>has some number of legs</li>
    <li>makes a noise</li>
</ul>

<p>I can think of lots of animals like that, so we'll stick with that for now and cover our topic by means of example.</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        class Animal(legs: Int, noise: String)
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Here we've added something called a "constructor", which allows us to pass parameters into our class that give it different data.
</p>

<p>
    The issue here though is that while we're passing some data into our class, we can't actually use it because it's not
    part of the class, as it's a constructor parameter, it's only used in it's <em>construction</em>. If we don't do anything
    with it, it just gets thrown away.
</p>
<p>This means if you try and call <code>eric.noise</code>, it will say it doesn't exist</p>

<p>
    To fix this we need to create some properties in the class that we can assign our constructor values to, though Scala
    has a special syntax for turning constructor parameters into class properties (most commonly called "class members")
    - you just add <code>val</code> before the parameter and it becomes a field.
</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        class Animal(val legs: Int, val noise: String)
        val eric = new Animal(legs = 4, noise = "Miaow")
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Now we can call <code>eric.noise</code> and it will return "Miaow".</p>

<h2>Making different animals - extending classes</h2>

<p>
    As well as being instantiated, classes can also be <em>extended</em>. This means in our example that we can create
    new classes that represent specific animals and can have different, animal specific properties and methods, but also
    share all the same functionality of the base Animal class.
</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        class Animal(val legs: Int, val noise: String)

        class Cat extends Animal(legs = 4, noise = "Miaow) {
            def scratch: Unit = println("I'm scratching")
        }

        val spooky = new Cat

        spooky.scratch
        spooky.legs // should exist and equal 4
        spooky.noise // should be "Miaow"
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Here we've created a <code>Cat</code> class that adds a scratch method. A base animal can't scratch, but a Cat now can,
    but cat also inherits the <code>legs</code> and <code>noise</code> values too.
</p>

<p>
    We might want to be able to describe every animal, based on how many legs it has and the noise it makes. It makes sense
    to add this to Animal so we can call it on anything that's an Animal or anything that extends it.
</p>

<p>
    Note though that although Cat inherits everything that Animal has, it's a one way door and Animal can't access anything
    specific to Cat.
</p>
<br>

<pre>
    <code>
        class Animal(val legs: Int, val noise: String) {
            private val animalName = getClass.getSimpleName

            def describe = println(s"I'm a $animalName, I have $legs legs and I go $noise!")
        }

        class Cat extends Animal(legs = 4, noise = "Miaow) {
            def scratch: Unit = println("I'm scratching")
        }

        val eric = new Cat

        eric.describe // should print out "I'm a Cat, I have 4 legs and I go Miaow!"
    </code>
</pre>

<h2>Take aways</h2>

<ul>
    <li>a class is like a "blueprint" for a data type that has the same properties and methods</li>
    <li>you can create instances of a class that can all have different data, but follow the same "blueprint"</li>
    <li>you can create new classes that extend other classes which have their own class-specific properties, plus the
        properties of the base class</li>
</ul>
